## Requirements
The Ivor Paine Memorial Hospital wishes to develop a database system. The hospital is organized in the following way.

There are number of wards each of which contain a number of patients. A patient may be assigned to only one ward. Each ward has a unique name. Wards cater for certain specialties e.g., orthopedic, geriatric etc. A ward may cater for only specialty but a specialty may be treated on more than one ward.

Working on each wards are number of nurses: a day sister, a night sister, a number of staff nurses and a number of non-registered nurses. A nurse works on one ward only. On a ward patients are grouped into care-units. Each care-unit has a unique number within the hospital. For each care-unit a group of nurses is allocated to care solely for the patients in that particular care-unit. A staff nurse is in charge of each care-unit. A nurse is only ever involved with a single care unit. A patient can only belong to one care unit.

In the hospital there are number of doctors, a few of which hold the position of consultant. Each consultant has a single specialty although there may be a number of consultants with an identical specialty. Each consultant has a team of doctors. A doctor can belong to only one team at a time. A patient is in the charge of just one doctor but may receive treatment from more than one doctor depending on the type of complaint(s) the patient may have.

At present the hospital has a manual record system but this needs rationalization. It is hoped that the new computerized system will remove data redundancy that at the same time service the information needs of the various user groups in the hospital.
